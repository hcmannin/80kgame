# carrot 80kgame

what i (hanne) did so far: 
- character colliding with carrots: 
     - makes a noise
     - carrots "bar" goes up by one
- "wood" button (press it to buy wood):
     - wood "bar" goes up by one each click; carrot "bar" goes down each click

what we need to do:
- a "buy house" button:
    - depletes "wood" bar by ~6 increments (or whatever increment u want)
    - when "buy house" button is clicked, a house appears
- buy soil to grow more carrots - buy with carrots

bugs/issues:
- Character goes behind the "soil", and idk how to fix that
